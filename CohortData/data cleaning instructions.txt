run cleaningScript.py to produce 2 csv files containing cleaned data:

	Deleted samples with negative values in responses, except in the columns listed in constants.py
	Kept samples with null values. (For now)

	Samples with -4 in curr_pregnant, are changed to have values of 2.

	Outliers in column hrs_worked_last_year were replaced with the 3rd standard devision.

	The null values in column number_of_kids were imputed by linear regression.
	number_of_kids is currently a decimal number, will be floored or ceilinged later.

	Added new column highest_grade_binned, which is highest_grade discretized.
